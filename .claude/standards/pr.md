# Pull request reference

## Scope

Governs a pull request title and body: their format and the sections the body carries.

Does not govern:

- Commit subject format, which shares the title form: `commit.md`
- Branch naming: `branch.md`
- Whether a phase label or a semver tag may appear in a title or body: `versioning.md`
- Voice and banned words in pull request prose: `prose.md`
- Punctuation and formatting in pull request prose: `markdown.md`

## Title

- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Casing: lowercase for `<type>`, `<scope>`, and first word of `<subject>`
- Length: 72 characters maximum

## Content

- Use imperative mood for all content (`add`, `fix`, `refactor`)
- Do not start with "This PR," "This commit," "Included are," or "I have"
- Do not use buzzwords (`seamless`, `robust`, `game-changer`, `enhanced`)
- Do not describe historical behavior or unchanged code. Describe new behavior only.
- Do not include future promises or speculative documentation
- Do not explain obvious changes (formatting, renaming variables)
- Do not duplicate commit messages verbatim

## Sections

- `## Summary`: 1-2 sentences following `<Action Verb> <Direct Object> to <Result>`, expand for clarity if needed
- `## Key Changes`: name actual files, functions, or modules (e.g., `AuthService.verify()` not "auth handler"). Always use bullet points, never prose.
- `## Technical Context` (optional): 1-2 lines of architectural reasoning explaining why, not what
- Omit Technical Context for docs, config, or trivial changes
- Use bullet points for multiple reasons, one sentence for a single reason
- `## Testing` (optional): specify exact commands or test cases run
- Omit Testing for docs, config, or trivial sync changes
- Use checkboxes, never prose. See Testing discipline for which box gets ticked.
- `## For the reviewer` (optional): what the reviewer should confirm, one bullet per request
- Visuals: include only when they clarify architecture, UI, or complex logic flows

## Testing discipline

- Run the check before writing its line. A `- [ ]` reports a check that has not run rather than one that is planned.
- Tick the box and state the observed result. `- [x] npm test passes, 42 tests` beats `- [ ] run npm test`.
- Quote the count or output the run reported, never a figure carried from elsewhere.
- Leave a box unchecked only when a human is required, and name which human and why on the same line.
- Human-only covers visual or aesthetic judgment, anything needing credentials or a live third-party service, anything needing a second machine or a fresh OS, and judgment about whether a boundary or an abstraction reads correctly. The agent runs everything else.
- Put a request for the reviewer under `## For the reviewer`. It is a request rather than unfinished testing, so it never appears as an unchecked Testing box.

## Formatting

- End every bullet point with a period

## Examples

### Template

```markdown
## Summary

<Action Verb> <Direct Object> to <Result>.

## Key Changes

- <Verb> <specific component/file/function> (<reason if non-obvious>)
- <Verb> <specific component/file/function>

## Technical Context

- <Architectural reasoning explaining why, not what>

## Testing

- [x] <Command run> <observed result>
- [x] <Edge case verified> <what was observed>
- [ ] <Human-only check> (<which human, why>)

## For the reviewer

- <What the reviewer should confirm>
```

### Correct

```markdown
## Summary

Update auth middleware to enforce jwt expiration checks. # imperative + direct object + result

## Key Changes

- Add `verifyExpiration()` to `src/auth/validators.ts`. # specific function + file path
- Refactor `AuthService.authenticate()` to handle 401 codes. # named component + clear change

## Technical Context

- Migration to stateless session management for horizontal scalability. # why, not what

## Testing

- [x] `npm run test:auth` passes, 42 tests. # command run + observed result
- [x] Expired token rejected with a 401 against a local server. # edge case + what happened
- [ ] Staging smoke test (release owner, needs staging credentials). # unchecked + which human + why

## For the reviewer

- Confirm the 401 and 403 split reads correctly for the public API. # a request, not a test result
```

### Incorrect

```markdown
## Summary

This PR updates the authentication system to be more robust. # "This PR" opener + buzzword

## Key Changes

- Updated auth middleware files # vague, no specific component, no period
- The old system used to check tokens differently # describes historical behavior

## Testing

- Tested manually # no specific command or case
- [ ] `npm run test:auth` # unchecked box for a check the agent can run
- [ ] Reviewer confirms the error split reads correctly # a reviewer request, belongs under `## For the reviewer`
```
