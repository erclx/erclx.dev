# Readme reference

Applies to every `README.md`. The `## Voice` section states the voice for a repository's root README, so `prose.md` yields to it there. The yield covers voice alone. The spelling rules and banned words in `prose.md` stay in force, as do the punctuation and formatting rules in `markdown.md`, so the warmer register ships with the same hygiene: no em dashes, no semicolons, no buzzwords.

The reader is what changes. Reference prose serves someone who already committed to the project and is scanning for a fact. A root README meets someone deciding whether to commit at all, and it is often the only file they read.

## Scope

Governs every `README.md`: voice, heading structure, required and optional sections, badge selection, and what the page links out to instead of carrying.

Does not govern:

- Spelling and banned words in README prose: `prose.md`, which yields the voice and keeps the rest
- Punctuation and formatting in README prose: `markdown.md`, which yields nothing
- Product scope and goals: `requirements.md`

## Voice

Scoped to the README at a repository root. A nested README documenting a folder, a harness, or an internal tool keeps the reference voice in `prose.md`, since its reader has already committed and arrived looking for a fact.

- Address the reader in second person. First-person plural needs an authoring organization as its antecedent, so a single-maintainer project has none to use.
- Use contractions wherever the sentence reads better for one. Do not force them in.
- Write with a point of view. State what the project chose and why, not a neutral survey of the options it passed over.
- Ground a claim in something concrete rather than an adjective. A command, a number, or a named constraint carries more than a description of quality.
- Be honest about limits. Naming what the project does not do reads as more credible, not less.

## Structure

- H1 title, H2 major sections, H3 subsections. Maintain proper hierarchy for GitHub's auto-generated table of contents.
- Use sentence case for all headings (proper nouns and product names retain their casing)
- Project description in plain text directly under H1. Keep it to 2-3 sentences.
- Do not create deeply nested heading structures that harm scannability
- Do not use horizontal rules or dividers (`---`)

## Sections

- Required: project description, installation/setup, usage examples, support/help resources
- Optional: badges (at top, before description), features, contributing (link to `CONTRIBUTING.md`), license (link to `LICENSE`)
- Do not include full API documentation. Link to separate docs instead.
- Do not include license text. Reference the `LICENSE` file.
- Do not include detailed contribution guidelines. Reference `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Do not include extensive troubleshooting guides. Use a wiki or separate documentation.

### Badges

A badge earns its place by carrying a fact the reader cannot get from the page they are already on. Three classes pass that test.

- Package version, which reports what the registry actually published rather than what the working tree claims
- Build or CI status, which reports whether the checks are currently passing
- License, which passes because a README rendered on a registry page has no host sidebar stating it

Stars, forks, download counts, language chips, and "made with" badges fail. The first three restate what a repository host already renders above the README, and the rest decorate.

- Cap the block at four. A fifth costs more scanning than any badge repays.
- Give each badge alt text naming what it reports rather than the service that renders it. Write `npm version`, not `shields.io`.
- Link each badge to the page a doubting reader would check next, which is the registry listing for a version badge and the run history for a status badge. A red badge with no route to the failing run reports a problem and withholds the only thing the reader wants.
- Pin a status badge to the branch whose health it claims to report, and confirm the workflow actually runs on that branch. A workflow triggered by pull requests alone never runs on the default branch, so an unpinned badge reports whichever branch ran last and a pinned one reports nothing at all. Fix the trigger, or drop the badge under the rule below.
- Verify a badge by the value it renders, not by its status code. A badge service answers 200 for a query it cannot satisfy, so a blank badge and a working one look identical to a status check.
- Zero badges is a correct answer. A private project with no registry presence and no CI has nothing that passes the test, and an empty block beats a padded one.

## Content

- Open public-facing READMEs with universal problems any reader recognizes, not repo-specific artifact names. Save artifact names for feature or "What is inside" sections.
- Use relative paths for repository files. Use absolute URLs for external resources.
- Include practical usage snippets for core functionality
- For libraries/tools: include API quickstart
- For applications/products: include usage instructions and configuration options
- For CLI tools: include command examples with flags
- For agent-facing repositories: name the file an agent loads first and the command that lists what the project exposes
- For marketplace-distributed plugins: give the install command for every channel the project publishes to

A project is often several of these at once. Cover every type that applies rather than picking the closest one. A repository that ships a CLI, distributes a plugin, and holds agent conventions owes its reader all three.
